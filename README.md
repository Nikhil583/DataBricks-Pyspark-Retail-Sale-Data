# DataBricks-Pyspark-Retail-Sale-Data


Retail Sales Analytics Platform using Medallion Architecture in Databricks


📌 Business Use Case

A mid-size retail company is struggling to consolidate and analyze its sales transactions that are spread across different sources and formats.
The business wants a unified analytics solution to:

clean messy data (inconsistent formats, missing values, duplicates),

build a single source of truth for sales, customers, and products,

monitor KPIs such as revenue, return rate, repeat customers, average order value,

enable business teams to explore insights across product, category, customer, and time dimensions,

and use dashboards for data-driven decisions (e.g., inventory, pricing, promotions).

Databricks Free Edition with a Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) is chosen to demonstrate how raw retail data can be transformed into actionable insights.


📌 Business Problem Statement

The retail business faces the following challenges:

Messy Transaction Data

Dates recorded in multiple formats (yyyy-MM-dd, dd/MM/yyyy, etc.)

Price fields with mixed symbols ($19.99, 19.99, missing values)

Inconsistent product names (T-shirt XL, tshirt xl)

Duplicates and missing customer IDs

Limited Visibility into KPIs

No clear picture of total revenue, orders, or customer lifetime value (CLV)

Unable to track returns, refund impact, or return rates

No insights on monthly growth trends, top products, or category performance

Difficulty in Customer Analysis

Hard to identify repeat vs one-time customers

No way to measure purchase frequency or churn risk

Lack of understanding of product-customer associations

Manual Reporting Pain Points

Business teams spend days cleaning spreadsheets

Insights are delayed and not real-time

Decisions (inventory, promotions, pricing) are reactive, not proactive



Proposed Solution (Your Project)

Bronze Layer: Ingest messy CSV/Parquet files manually (as simulated in Databricks free edition).

Silver Layer: Clean and standardize data (fix dates, remove $ from prices, normalize product names, handle missing/negative quantities, remove duplicates).

Gold Layer: Create one rich aggregate Delta table with grouped metrics across product, customer, category, and time (year, month, date).

KPIs Derived:

Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total Items Sold

Average Order Value (AOV), Average Price per Item

Repeat Customer Rate, Purchase Frequency

Return Rate (by count & value)

Monthly Sales Trends & MoM Growth

Top Products by Revenue and Quantity

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) approximation

Dashboard: Build a Databricks SQL Dashboard showing trends, category performance, top products, and customer insights.
